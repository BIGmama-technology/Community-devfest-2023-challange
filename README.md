# Tobib.ai : Enabling Access to Remote Medical Diagnosis

## Overview

Tobib.ai aims to bridge the healthcare gap for marginalized communities in Africa and globally by providing an AI-driven platform for pre-diagnostic support. With Tobib we aim to offer an affordable solution for individuals to consult a chatbot about their health concerns.

The chatbot utilizes a comprehensive knowledge structure, either a knowledge graph or a decision tree, to intelligently query users about their symptoms.

**The goal is not to diagnose** but to guide users in collecting pertinent medical records, such as CT scans, X-rays, or blood tests, and answering key questions. This prepared file will then assist **real** remote doctors on Tobib.ai in making a diagnosis.

## Ethical Consideration

We recognize concerns regarding the potential for misinformation by current Large Language Models (LLMs). However, in regions where medical assistance is scarce, introducing even a small success probability is a great thing. The chatbot serves as a preparatory tool, not a diagnostician; it is real medical professionals who will offer the final judgment based on the compiled data.

## Core Features

The platform is designed with a focus on:

- **File Management**: Efficient organization and retrieval of medical records.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: User-friendly symptom assessment with a chatbot.
- **User & Doctor Management**: Seamless interaction and coordination between users and doctors.
- **Collaborative Access**: Multiple stakeholders can view and comment on medical files, enhancing collaborative care.

## Key Guidelines

- **No OpenAI API**: To encourage innovation, usage of the OpenAI API will result in disqualification. Participants must utilize open-source LLMs.
- **Remote Machine Access**: Participants will have access to a remote server (details provided) to deploy LLMs.
- **Prototype Development**: Building a working prototype will be rewarded with bonus points.
- **Starter Kit**: A foundational project is provided to kickstart development, **workshops will be held to help participants get started.**.

## Workshops

- **Deploy your AI model as an API**, held by Hachem at **11:00 AM** on the **1st day** of the hackathon.
- **Building seamless collaborative experience with nextjs and liveblocks**, held by Ouassim at **9:00 AM** on the **2nd day**.
